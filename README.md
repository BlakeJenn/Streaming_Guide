# Streaming_Guide
A manipulatable database of streaming services and which shows they carry.

A StreamingGuide will have a list of StreamingService objects, and a Streaming Service will have a dictionary of Movie objects. 
The where_to_watch_movie method needs to use this nested information to determine which StreamingServices, if any, have the desired movie available.
